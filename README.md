# University Document Portal

An AI-enhanced academic-document application portal (transcripts, migration certificates, duplicate
grade cards, provisional degree certificates) - SDP (Course 20ECSW401), Team 27.

A student registers, submits an application with supporting documents, and the portal **automatically**
reads the documents (OCR), checks eligibility with deterministic rules, shows the fee, and lets the student
make a **sandbox** payment while following a status timeline.

> **Prototype limitations - please read**
> * All student records and applications are **simulated**. No real university data is used.
> * Payment is a **mock/sandbox**: no gateway is contacted and no money moves. The student chooses
>   "success" or "failure" to simulate the gateway's answer.
> * **Policy is not verified.** No official KLE Tech notice listing the required documents, fees or eligibility
>   conditions for these four requests could be found. The document lists are provisional (the portal says so), the fee
>   schedule is a placeholder, and **no CGPA, backlog or fee-clearance rule exists**. See section 3.
> * This is a student project, **not** an official university service.
> * The admin side (review, dashboard, document generation) is not built yet; after payment an application
>   simply stays at "Payment completed". The three ML components (forecasting, risk scoring, anomaly detection)
>   exist as admin-only API endpoints and are not part of the student screens.

**Stack:** Next.js (React, JavaScript) - FastAPI - PostgreSQL - SQLAlchemy + Alembic - Tesseract OCR - scikit-learn / LightGBM.

## 1. Run with Docker Desktop (Windows)

### Prerequisites
* **Windows 10/11** with **Docker Desktop** installed and running (WSL 2 backend is the default; wait until the
  whale icon says "Engine running"). Check in PowerShell: `docker --version` and `docker compose version`.
* Free ports **3000** (frontend) and **8000** (backend). Change them in `.env` if needed (see below).
* Nothing else: PostgreSQL, Python, Node.js, Tesseract and Poppler all run **inside** the containers.

### Step 1 - Create `.env` (secrets)
Open PowerShell **in the project folder** (the one containing `compose.yaml`) and run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup-env.ps1
```

This copies `.env.example` to `.env` and fills in a random `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `SECRET_KEY`. (Manual
alternative: `Copy-Item .env.example .env`, then replace both `CHANGE_ME...` values yourself; `SECRET_KEY` must be
random and 32+ characters, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` letters/digits only.) `.env` is git-ignored and never copied into images.

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_DB` | Database user / name inside the `db` container | `sdp_user` / `sdp_portal` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Database password (letters and digits only) | *you set it* |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Signs login tokens (32+ random characters) | *you set it* |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | Login lifetime | `60` |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | Max size per uploaded file | `5` |
| `MAX_FILES_PER_APPLICATION` | Max files per application | `5` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Browser origins allowed to call the API | `http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000` |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` / `BACKEND_PORT` | Ports published on your PC | `3000` / `8000` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | Address **the browser** uses for the API (compiled into the frontend) | `http://localhost:8000` |

### Step 2 - Build and start

```powershell
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps
```

The first build downloads images and installs everything (several minutes). Start-up order is automatic:
`db` becomes healthy -> `backend` runs migrations + seeding and becomes healthy -> `frontend` starts.
`docker compose ps` should show all three services `running`/`healthy`.

* Student portal: <http://localhost:3000>
* API documentation (Swagger UI): <http://localhost:8000/docs>
* Health checks (diagnostics only): <http://localhost:8000/api/health> and <http://localhost:8000/api/health/db>

### What happens on every start (migrations and seeding)
`backend/docker-entrypoint.sh` runs, in order: `alembic upgrade head` -> `python -m app.db.seed` (4 document
types) -> `python -m app.db.seed_students` (12 simulated students) -> API server. All steps are **idempotent**: a
restart applies no migration twice and adds only missing seed rows, so records are never duplicated.
Container-to-container, the backend reaches PostgreSQL at host `db` (the Compose service name), not `localhost`.

### Step 3 - Register and sign in as a simulated student
1. Open <http://localhost:3000> and click **Register**.
2. Enter a USN in `01FE{YY}{BRANCH}{NNN}` format (e.g. `01FE23CSE001`), any email (e.g. `student1@example.com`)
   and a password of 8+ characters. The format is validated first, then registration links the login to the
   **pre-loaded simulated** student record; a structurally valid but unknown USN is still rejected.
3. You are signed in and land on the dashboard. Next time use **Sign in**.

Seeded USNs (simulated data from `backend/app/db/seed_students.py`). Their CGPA, backlog and fee fields are
**not used** by eligibility (see section 3), so any of them can demonstrate every outcome. What decides the outcome
is the details and documents you submit:

| What you do | Expected outcome |
|---|---|
| Attach scans whose text shows **your own USN** (the included sample does for `01FE23CSE001`) | **Eligible** |
| Attach a scan showing a **different** USN, or one where no USN can be read | **Needs verification** (not a rejection) |
| Provisional Degree Certificate: answer **No** to "completed all requirements" or "result declared" | **Needs verification** |

(`01FE23CSE001` is the easiest to use for a first run.)

### Step 4 - Submit an application and watch the automatic flow
1. Click **New application** and choose one of the four requests. The form changes to show **that request's own details
   and required documents** (e.g. a Duplicate Grade Card asks for the semesters, exam session and a declaration of loss; a
   Transcript asks for purpose and number of copies). Your name, USN, department and email come from your student record.
2. Fill the details (fields marked * are required) and attach **one file per document slot**. For a first run register
   `01FE23CSE001` and attach `samples\sample_document_01FE23CSE001.png` to every slot (it shows that USN). Limits: PDF, JPG,
   JPEG or PNG; 5 MB per file; 5 files per application. Wrong type/content, oversize and missing required files are
   flagged immediately.
3. Click **Submit application**. An upload progress bar appears, then you are taken to the application page.
4. Without clicking anything else, the **Progress** panel moves through *Application submitted -> Extracting document
   information -> Checking eligibility*, and the timeline records the result. *Submitted documents* shows each file's label and
   the extracted USN / CGPA-like values / dates; *Request details* shows what you entered.
5. **Eligible:** the fee is shown and **Proceed to sandbox payment** appears. Choose **Simulate failed payment** (a **Retry
   payment** button appears) or **Simulate successful payment** (status becomes *Payment completed*). Nothing is paid automatically.
6. **Needs verification / Not eligible:** the reasons are listed and there is **no payment option**; the server also refuses
   payment for these applications. Verification by a person is part of the later admin phase and is **not built yet**, so such an
   application stays at that status in this prototype.

If a file cannot be read (e.g. a corrupt PDF) the page says so, keeps your application and files, **does not run the
eligibility check**, and offers an explicit **Retry document processing** button.

### Logs, stopping, data

```powershell
docker compose logs -f                 # follow all services (Ctrl+C stops following, not the app)
docker compose logs -f backend         # just the backend (migrations, seeding, requests, errors)
docker compose logs db
docker compose ps

docker compose stop                    # stop, keep containers
docker compose down                    # stop and remove containers - database and uploads are KEPT
docker compose up -d                   # start again; add --build after code or NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL changes
```

**Preserving data.** The database lives in the named volume `sdp-portal_pgdata` and uploaded documents in
`sdp-portal_uploads`. `docker compose down`, rebuilds and `docker compose up --build` keep both.

**Deliberate reset (deletes ALL demo data - applications, accounts, uploaded files):**

```powershell
docker compose down -v                 # -v removes the two named volumes
docker compose up --build -d           # fresh database: migrations + seeds run again
```

Run the backend tests inside the container (uses the real database, rolls back its writes, uses a temp upload folder):

```powershell
docker compose exec backend python -m pytest -q
```

> **Caveat:** several existing tests register the seeded USNs (e.g. `01FE23CSE001`) and expect them to be unregistered. Run the tests
> on a database where you have not registered those students yet (a fresh start, or after `docker compose down -v`); otherwise they fail with
> `409 This USN already has an account`. The tests themselves roll back and leave no rows behind.

### Troubleshooting
* **`docker compose` cannot connect / "error during connect"** - Docker Desktop is not running. Start it and wait for "Engine running".
* **`required variable POSTGRES_PASSWORD / SECRET_KEY is missing`** - there is no `.env` yet (Step 1).
* **Backend container keeps restarting** - `docker compose logs backend`. Typical causes: `SECRET_KEY` still the placeholder
  or shorter than 32 characters; a `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` changed after the database volume was first created (the old password
  is stored in the volume - either restore the old value or reset with `docker compose down -v`).
* **Port already in use** - set `FRONTEND_PORT` / `BACKEND_PORT` in `.env` (if you change `BACKEND_PORT`, also change
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to the same port, and add a custom frontend origin to `CORS_ORIGINS` if you change `FRONTEND_PORT`),
  then `docker compose up --build -d`.
* **Pages load but sign-in/registration says "Could not reach the server"** - the browser cannot reach the API address that was
  compiled in. Confirm <http://localhost:8000/api/health> opens, and that `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` matches it; rebuild after changing it.
* **Browser console shows a CORS error** - open the site at `http://localhost:3000` (or add the origin you use to `CORS_ORIGINS`) and restart the backend.
* **"No student record found for this USN"** - use one of the seeded USNs above (letters are normalised to upper case).
* **OCR shows "Could not be read"** - the file is corrupt or not a genuine PDF/JPG/PNG; upload another and use *Retry document processing*.
* **Shell script errors like `\r: command not found`** - a CRLF checkout of `docker-entrypoint.sh`. The Dockerfile normalises it; if it still occurs, run `docker compose build --no-cache backend`.
* **Slow first build** - normal; later builds reuse cached layers.

## 2. What changed in the student portal
* New landing page, navigation that depends on sign-in state, a dashboard (welcome, counts, recent applications),
  a redesigned application form (type cards, drag-and-drop, per-file removal, validation, upload progress) and an application page
  (progress tracker, eligibility result, fee + sandbox payment, documents with OCR results, summary, timeline).
* **Automatic workflow.** New endpoint `POST /api/applications/{id}/process` chains the existing services
  (`run_ocr_for_application` -> `run_eligibility_for_application`), so every status change still goes through `set_status()` and is written
  to `application_status_history`. It is idempotent and serialised per application with a PostgreSQL advisory lock (tabs, refreshes and double
  clicks cannot cause duplicate OCR/eligibility runs); eligibility runs only if OCR succeeded for **every** file; `?retry_ocr=true` is the
  only way to re-run OCR; it never starts a payment. `ApplicationDetail` also exposes `fee_amount` so the UI shows the backend's fee.
* The existing `/ocr`, `/eligibility`, `/payment/*` endpoints and the database schema are unchanged. Eligibility is decided only by the backend.

## 3. Request forms, upload limits and eligibility policy

### Where things are configured (one place each)
| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Details each request asks for, required/optional documents, "verified" flag | `backend/app/core/request_types.py` |
| Max files per application (default 5) and max MB per file (default 5) | `MAX_FILES_PER_APPLICATION`, `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` in `.env` (read by `backend/app/core/config.py`) |
| Which eligibility rules apply to which request, and whether each is verified | `POLICY` section of `backend/app/services/eligibility.py` |

The portal renders its forms and upload rules from `GET /api/request-types`, and the backend validates every
submission against the same definitions, so the two cannot drift. After changing `.env`, restart with
`docker compose up -d` (limits) - no rebuild is needed because the frontend reads them from the API.

### Upload validation (frontend and backend)
Allowed: PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG. Checked: extension, **actual file content** (leading bytes must match the extension),
size (<= 5 MB), non-empty, and file count (<= 5), plus: every required document slot filled, each slot used once.
The backend validates everything before saving anything; the OCR workflow is unchanged.

### Eligibility outcomes
| Outcome | Stored status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ELIGIBLE` | `ELIGIBLE` | all automatic checks passed - payment may start |
| `INELIGIBLE` | `NOT_ELIGIBLE` | a **verified** policy condition is not met (existing status value reused, so no data changes) |
| `MANUAL_REVIEW` | `MANUAL_REVIEW` ("Needs verification") | cannot be confirmed automatically - payment is on hold until a person verifies |

Each decision stores its reasons (`eligibility_result` on the application, also written to the status timeline).
Payment can start **only** when the stored decision is `ELIGIBLE` and the application belongs to the signed-in student;
the server enforces this (the UI only reflects it).

Rules in the default policy: (1) required documents provided; (2) the student's USN is found on documents that normally carry it -
**not found, unreadable or a different USN means `MANUAL_REVIEW`, never a rejection**; (3) Provisional Degree Certificate only: the student
did not declare that results/requirements are incomplete. A rule can only produce `INELIGIBLE` once it is marked `verified=True`;
until then a failure is routed to `MANUAL_REVIEW` and says so. **Therefore, with the shipped policy no application is automatically rejected.**

### What is NOT verified (needs the Examination Section's real notice)
These are marked unverified in code and shown as such to students. Please confirm them before treating this as real policy:
1. The list of required/optional supporting documents for each of the four requests (provisional lists in `request_types.py`).
2. The details each form should collect.
3. Whether "degree requirements / results not complete" makes a Provisional Degree Certificate request ineligible (rule 3 above).
4. Fees (`backend/app/services/payments.py` is still the earlier sandbox placeholder schedule).
CGPA, backlog and fee-clearance restrictions were deliberately **not** implemented: no official source for them was found.
The student's CGPA/backlog/fee fields stay in the database but are unused.

# Appendices

## Appendix A - Tech stack
Next.js (React, JavaScript) · FastAPI (Python) · PostgreSQL · SQLAlchemy 2 + Alembic · pytest

## Appendix B - Manual (non-Docker) setup

Only needed if you do not use Docker. Prerequisites:

| Tool | Version used for testing |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.12 (3.11+ recommended) |
| Node.js | 22 (20.9+ required by Next.js 16) |
| PostgreSQL | 16 (15+ should work) |
| Tesseract OCR | 5.x (`tesseract-ocr` system package) — needed for Phase 3 OCR |
| Poppler | `poppler-utils` system package (provides `pdftoppm`) — needed to OCR PDF uploads |

On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr poppler-utils`.

### B1. Create the database (once)
Open `psql` as the PostgreSQL admin user and run (choose your own password):

```sql
CREATE USER sdp_user WITH PASSWORD 'choose_a_password';
CREATE DATABASE sdp_portal OWNER sdp_user;
```

### B2. Backend (FastAPI)
From the project root:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv

# activate the virtual environment
#   Windows PowerShell:  .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
#   macOS / Linux:       source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# create your local config, then edit DATABASE_URL, and set SECRET_KEY (see below)
#   Windows:  copy .env.example .env
#   macOS / Linux:  cp .env.example .env

alembic upgrade head          # create the tables
python -m app.db.seed          # insert the 4 document types (safe to re-run)
python -m app.db.seed_students # insert 12 SIMULATED student records (safe to re-run)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

If your password contains special characters, URL-encode them in `DATABASE_URL`
(e.g. `@` becomes `%40`, `%` becomes `%25`, `:` becomes `%3A`).

**`SECRET_KEY`** signs login tokens and must be a random value, not the placeholder. Generate one
and paste it into `backend/.env`:
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
```

* API docs: <http://localhost:8000/docs>
* Health check: <http://localhost:8000/api/health> and <http://localhost:8000/api/health/db>

#### Sign in as a student
Student records are simulated (`python -m app.db.seed_students`); there is no real KLE Tech data.
Register a login for one of the seeded USNs (`01FE23CSE001` … `01FE23CIV002`, see
`app/db/seed_students.py` for the full list) at `/register` with any email and an 8+ character
password, then sign in at `/login`.

### B3. Frontend (Next.js)
In a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. If your backend is not at `http://localhost:8000`, copy
`frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local` and change the URL.

From the home page, **Register** with a seeded USN, then from the dashboard start a **New
application**, optionally attach a PDF/JPG/PNG, and submit. You'll land on the application's
status page; **Dashboard** lists all of your applications.

#### How an application is processed
After a student submits an application, OCR and the eligibility check run automatically (see the
main guide above). The individual endpoints `POST /api/applications/{id}/ocr` and `/eligibility` still
exist for API users; the portal uses `POST /api/applications/{id}/process`.

### B4. Run the backend tests
With the backend virtual environment active and the database migrated and seeded:

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

Expected: `166 passed`. The tests use the database from `backend/.env`; each test runs in a
transaction that is rolled back afterwards, and uploaded test files go to a temporary folder, so
running the suite never touches your real data or your real `backend/uploads/` folder. The OCR
tests run the real Tesseract/poppler pipeline against generated sample images/PDFs (no mocking),
so `tesseract-ocr` and `poppler-utils` must be installed for the full suite to pass.

## Appendix D - ML datasets (Phase 4)

Phase 4 is a separate, standalone subproject under `ml/` — it does not touch the running
application, and generates only **simulated** data (no real KLE Tech records). See
`ml/README.md` for setup/run/test commands and `docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` for what every file and
column means.

## Appendix E - ML models and endpoints (Phase 5)

Three ML components, all trained on the **simulated** Phase 4 data and used as admin decision support only (they never
decide eligibility, reject payments or change a status). Train (from the project root, ~seconds each):
`python -m ml.forecasting`, `python -m ml.risk_scoring`, `python -m ml.anomaly`. Tests: `python -m pytest ml -q`.
Admin-only endpoints (each backed by `backend/app/services/ml_services.py`): `GET /api/forecast/demand`,
`POST /api/forecast/tat`, `POST /api/risk/score`, `POST /api/anomaly/score`. Details and metrics: `PHASE_5_STATUS.md`,
`PHASE_5_1_STATUS.md`, `PHASE_5_2_STATUS.md`, `PHASE_5_3_STATUS.md`. Install the ML libraries via `backend/requirements.txt`.

## Appendix F - Troubleshooting for the manual setup
* `password authentication failed`: the user/password in `backend/.env` does not match what you
  created in step 1.
* Frontend cards say "Failed": the backend is not running, or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` points to
  the wrong address. If the browser console mentions CORS, add your frontend URL to `CORS_ORIGINS`
  in `backend/.env` (comma-separated) and restart the backend.
* PowerShell blocks `Activate.ps1`: run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass` in that window first.
* Backend won't start / `pydantic_core.ValidationError` mentioning `secret_key`: set a real
  `SECRET_KEY` in `backend/.env` (see the command above); the placeholder is rejected on purpose.
* Register says "No student record found for this USN": run
  `python -m app.db.seed_students` and use one of the seeded USNs.
* Upload rejected with a "does not match its ... extension" error: the file's actual content
  doesn't match its extension (the check reads the file's bytes, not just its name).
* OCR step fails / `tesseract is not installed` or similar: install `tesseract-ocr` and
  `poppler-utils` (see Prerequisites above) and restart the backend.
