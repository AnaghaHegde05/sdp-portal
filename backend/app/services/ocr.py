"""OCR extraction for uploaded supporting documents (Phase 3).

Library choice (checked against what's actually installable/available in this sandbox before
committing): `pytesseract` (a thin wrapper around the Tesseract OCR engine, which is already
present as a system binary here) for the actual character recognition, plus `pdf2image` (a
wrapper around the `pdftoppm` binary, also already present via poppler-utils) to turn each PDF
page into an image first, since Tesseract itself only reads images. Both were verified installable
with plain `pip install` and both underlying system binaries (`tesseract`, `pdftoppm`) were already
on PATH in this environment, so no extra system packages were needed beyond what's used already.

This is a supporting document-processing step, not one of the three core ML components
(SDP_BUILD_GUIDE.md section 1.5) - kept deliberately simple: extract raw text, then a handful of
regex-based fields that are genuinely findable in an arbitrary scanned academic document (a USN,
a CGPA-shaped number, and any dates) without inventing document-specific templates.
